👋 Hi, I’m Beyza.

Computer Engineering graduate interested in **AI and computer vision**.  
I mostly work on **object detection, segmentation and image-based projects** using Python and deep learning models.

Here you’ll find:
- Personal and academic AI projects  
- Computer vision experiments and model trials  
- Learning-focused repositories and small tools  

I enjoy turning real-world problems into working models and improving them step by step.
